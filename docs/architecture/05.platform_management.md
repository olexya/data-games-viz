# Platform Management Tools

Platform management tools are essential for maintaining, optimizing, and governing data platforms. They encompass a wide range of functionalities including data quality assurance, data governance, workflow management, and even environmental impact management (Green IT). These tools help organizations ensure the reliability, compliance, and efficiency of their data operations.

## Data Quality

Data quality tools help organizations maintain the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of their data. They often include features for data profiling, cleansing, and monitoring.

## Governance

Data governance tools assist in managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data. They help enforce policies, standards, and regulations across the data lifecycle.

## Workflow Manager

Workflow managers orchestrate and automate complex data pipelines. They handle task scheduling, dependency management, and error handling in data processes.

## Green IT

Green IT tools focus on reducing the environmental impact of IT operations. In the context of data platforms, this often involves optimizing resource usage and energy consumption.
