Now comes the part of data transformation, which means moving from the bronze stage of data to the gold stage. There are many open-source tools available for this:
- [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) - a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing.
- [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/datafusion) - an open-source platform for building and deploying data integration pipelines.
- [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt) - a popular tool for transforming data into analytics-ready formats, requiring minimal to no code.
- [Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris) - a high-performance, cloud-native relational database management system.
- [Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink) - an open-source platform for distributed processing and stream processing.
- [Graph QL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql) - a query language for APIs that allows you to write queries in a type-safe way.
- [Hop](https://github.com/apache/hop) - an open-source data integration framework that enables the integration of various data sources.
- [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) - a distributed event-streaming platform designed for high-throughput and fault-tolerant data processing.
- [Kylin](https://github.com/apache/kylin) - an open-source analytics engine for big data, providing fast query performance on large-scale datasets.
- [Ml Flow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) - a popular open-source platform for machine learning experimentation and reproducibility.
- [Neondatabase](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon) - an open-source graph database designed to handle complex relationships between data entities.
- [Nifi](https://github.com/apache/nifi) - an open-source software for automating the flow of data from one application to another.
- [NodeRed](https://github.com/node-red/node-red) - a popular tool for integrating and orchestrating multiple devices, services, and APIs.
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- [Pinot (cache)](https://github.com/apache/pinot) - an open-source real-time analytics database designed for fast query performance on large-scale datasets.
- [Presto](https://github.com/prestodb/presto) - an open-source SQL engine that supports querying data from multiple sources.
- [Pulsar (Apache)](https://github.com/apache/pulsar) - a distributed messaging system designed for high-performance and low-latency communication.
- [Redpanda](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda) - an open-source, cloud-native message broker designed for high-throughput and fault-tolerant data processing.
- [Seatunnel](https://github.com/apache/seatunnel) - a real-time data integration platform that enables the seamless movement of data between various systems.
- [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) - an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing and machine learning.
- [Starrock](https://github.com/starrocks/starrocks) - an open-source column-store database designed for fast query performance on large-scale datasets.
- [Trino](https://github.com/trinodb/trino) - a popular open-source SQL engine that supports querying data from multiple sources, including cloud storage and relational databases.
- [Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) - an open-source cross-language development library designed for efficient processing of tabular data.
- [SQL Mesh](https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh) - a scalable, high-performance platform for SQL analytics and machine learning.
- [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) - a powerful, in-memory column-store database designed for fast query performance on large-scale datasets.

I tested tools like dbt, Nifi, and NodeRed, which are great for non-coders. However, I also explored pandas, Spark, and Dask, which are Python libraries that require some programming experience to use effectively.
