# Query and Processing Tools

Query and processing tools are essential components of any data analytics infrastructure. They enable organizations to extract insights from large volumes of data, perform complex computations, and support decision-making processes. These tools can be broadly categorized into three main areas: batch processing, query engines, and stream processing.

## Batch Processing

Batch processing involves processing large volumes of data at scheduled intervals. It's typically used for handling large datasets where immediate results are not required. Batch processing is efficient for complex analyses that require processing entire datasets.

## Query Engines

Query engines are designed to efficiently retrieve and analyze data from various sources. They allow users to write and execute queries, often using SQL or SQL-like languages, to extract specific information from databases or data lakes.

## Stream Processing

Stream processing deals with real-time data analysis. It processes data as it arrives, allowing for immediate insights and actions. This is particularly useful for scenarios requiring real-time decision making or continuous data analysis.

## Available Tools

Here is a summary table of the main query and processing tools we have identified:
