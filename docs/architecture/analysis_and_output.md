**Visualizing Data**

To display worked data, we use one of the following tools, which include no-code, low-code, and framework options.

- [Evidence](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence) - Evidence is a simple, open-source tool for creating interactive reports. It uses Markdown files to define SQL queries and visualizations.
- [Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset) - Superset is an open-source business intelligence platform that allows users to create dashboards and reports. It's built on top of PostgreSQL and offers a range of visualization options.
- [D3JS](https://github.com/d3/d3) - D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It's widely used for creating custom charts and graphs.
- [Chart JS](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) - Chart.js is a popular JavaScript charting library that makes it easy to create responsive, mobile-friendly charts. It supports a range of chart types, including line, bar, and pie charts.
- [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) - Metabase is an open-source business intelligence platform that allows users to create dashboards and reports. It's designed for self-service analytics and offers a range of visualization options.
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - Matplotlib is a Python plotting library that makes it easy to create high-quality 2D and 3D plots. It's widely used in scientific computing and data analysis.
- [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) - Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib. It offers a range of visualization options, including heatmaps, scatterplots, and bar charts.
- [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) - Plotly is an interactive visualization library that makes it easy to create web-based plots and dashboards. It supports a range of plot types, including line, bar, and 3D charts.
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) - Grafana is an open-source platform for building dashboards and visualizing data from multiple sources. It's widely used in monitoring and logging applications.
- [StreamLit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) - Streamlit is a Python library for building web-based data apps. It makes it easy to create interactive, web-based visualizations using popular libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly.

I have tested Metabase, Matplotlib, Grafana, Superset, and Evidence. All of these tools share a similar approach, but function differently.

Matplotlib is a Python module for creating graphs. However, it requires building the entire visualization platform from scratch.

On the other hand, Superset and Metabase guide users through a powerful tool. While they can be a bit heavy to install, the advantage is that they cater to an audience that cannot develop.

Evidence is an tool with an interface that only serves to visualize data. It requires writing Markdown files containing SQL queries to create reports.

For example, I chose Evidence for my open-source project because it's easy to use and highly customizable.
